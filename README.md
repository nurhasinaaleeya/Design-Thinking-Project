REFLECTION

My goal in this program is to sharpen my skills in terms of project management and broaden my knowledge in information technology. From this project, I have learned the proper ways to coordinate a project team and am also currently learning a lot more about the multimedia aspect of this project, which is especially useful for my course. UTM Food is a particularly interesting project that also makes me wonder what other problems faced by students can be solved if they are willing to dream up a solution to it. I want to improve myself further in terms of my social skills with my team and also sharpen my soft skills so that I can manage projects more efficiently in the future once I find myself in the industry.
